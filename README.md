# Local Setup

To develop locally, developers should have the following:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (PHP, MySQL)
- This repo. A fresh install of WordPress is included.

Note: MySQL credentials should be updated on the wp-config-sample.php file. The unique key and salt credentials have already been configured. This can be updated once again once we deploy to production.

# Work flow

1) The **master** branch will be the copy used in production.
2) The **development** branch (i.e - 'HGWP-2019-001) will be merged into master when a new release to production is ready.
3) The **developer** branch (i.e - 'Kevin') will be the name of the developer. This branch will include new changes to pushed to the development branch.
